Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term.

A:
- After completing different projects and having multiple versions, when I run into problems on new projects, I can look at differences between versions of old projects to understand what I did to get around them.

- I can experiment with different development strategies without having to worry about causing irreparable damage to work I've already done.
